# React Portfolio

The purpose of this project was to create a professional react portfolio  that showcases some of the past work I have
produced as well as to provide an easy access port to my resume and a quick and easy way to contact me.

## Technologies

In order to make this possible there were several new technologies that I utilized. For the contact form, emailjs and react-hook-form. For all of the styling on the page bootstrap 4.0 was used because it is simple and clean.
