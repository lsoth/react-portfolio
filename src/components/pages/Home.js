      <p>
      Hi, my name Leone Soth, and I am an ambitious new web developer and software engineer. I previously graduated from the University of Washington in 2018, with my B.S. in Biology:Physiology. I worked for two years at Bloodworks Northwest doing phlebotomy, to earn clinical hours to apply for physician assistant school. This past year COVID has changed a lot of things, and I have decided to pursue a new passion in coding! I hope to be able to apply my new skills to help develop health care applications and increase the accessibility of web based applications.
